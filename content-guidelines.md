# Content Guidelines

At Carter Chat we’re committed to creating an enjoyable experience for everyone. Here are the types of user-created content that are not allowed on our platform.

* **Child sexual content**: Absolutely no tolerance for any content of this nature.
* **Explicit images or nudity**: Any content that depicts sexual or explicit nudity.
* **Excessive gore**: Content that includes graphic violence or excessive depiction of blood and injury.

Your character may be removed, and in some cases your account will be suspended if it meets any of the above criteria.

#### Appeals Process

If your character is flagged and you believe it was moderated in error, you can contact us via [support@carter.chat](mailto:support@carter.chat) to request a review. We’re committed to fairness and will carefully assess all appeals.
