# Behaviours

Train your Character to detect custom phrases and topics. Trigger actions in your game and even respond with pre-written canned phrases.\

**Phrases**\
Examples of trigger phrases, these are used to train your Character when to correctly activate a behaviour. Our auto-generate tool allows you to generate similar phrases with AI (how meta!) to speed up this process. Phrases should accurately and diversely demonstrate examples of how your Player might trigger the behaviour.\
\
**Canned Responses**\
Add as many canned responses as you wish here. Your Character will randomly select one when a behaviour is activated. Leaving this list blank will silently return the behaviour (for your game's consumption) in the API response but will also allow for a completely AI generated output from the Character.\
