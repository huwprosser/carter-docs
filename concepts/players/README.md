# Players

A Player is a unique acquaintance of a Character. Characters can persist their relationship with each Player over time. \
\
**Player ID:**\
You can identify your player with any unique string sent to the API. This could be a device ID, UUID, PlayFab ID or anything else you want. If you want your player to be forgotten, simply provide a different player ID.

**Persist Rapport Over Time**\
Allowing your characters to get to know your Players allows for a closer and more personal rapport to form over time. Eventually leading to a sense of deep companionship, emotional commitment and immersion within your game.\
\
Player --> Character rapport is completely unique, meaning the rapport that builds up over time between your human Players and simulated Characters is unique, valuable and precious. \
