# World

The World of a character refers to the fictional or real-world context in which they exist. It encompasses the rules, norms, and expectations that govern the character's behavior and interactions with the environment and other characters. When designing a character, it's important to consider the World in which they exist, as it can greatly influence their personality, backstory, and overall behaviour.

For example, a character living in a post-apocalyptic world might have a more gritty and survivalist personality, while a character living in a utopian society might have a more optimistic and idealistic personality. Similarly, a character living in a fantasy world might have a more adventurous and magical personality, while a character living in a more mundane environment might have a more realistic and practical personality.

In addition to influencing the character's personality, the World can also affect the character's general knowledge and understanding of their surroundings. For instance, a character living in a medieval fantasy world might not have knowledge of modern technology, while a character living in a futuristic sci-fi world might have a deep understanding of advanced technology and scientific concepts. Understanding the World in which a character exists is crucial for creating a well-rounded and believable character.

When developing the World of a character, it's important to consider its history, culture, geography, and other relevant factors. This can help to create a more immersive and believable world, which in turn can enhance the user experience and engagement. By considering the World in which your character exists, you can create a more realistic and engaging character that users will enjoy interacting with.
