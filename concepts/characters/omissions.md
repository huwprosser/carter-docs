# Omissions

Omissions refer to the specific topics, types of language, or behaviors that a character should avoid using in their conversations with users. When designing a character, it's important to consider the preferences and expectations of your users, as well as the character's personality and values.

When creating a character, it's important to define their personality, values, and omissions. This can help to create a more consistent and believable character, and can also help to avoid situations where the character says or does something that is out of character or offensive to users.

To define omissions for your character, consider the following questions:

* What plot topics or spoilers should the character avoid discussing?
* What types of language or topics should the character avoid using or discussing?
* What behaviours or actions are not in line with the character's personality or values?

By answering these questions and defining omissions for your character, you can create a more user-friendly and engaging experience for your users.\

**Omissions should not be used as a safety feature and only to form the Character's values and steer the Character away from topics. Carter has a much more robust internal safety layer to prevent explicit, NSFW etc for every Character.**
