# Become a Developer

Run the following command in a chat with any Carter agent to become a developer:

```
/plugin dev start
```

Once you have agreed to the developer terms and conditions, you will be given a developer ID which you can use to submit plugins.

To show your developer ID again at any point, run the same command.

{% hint style="warning" %}
At the current time, becoming a developer and submitting plugins is tied to your user (unique to each DM with our Discord bots, and unique to each combination of API Key and user ID). For this reason, **we strongly recommend you use a DM with a single Carter Discord bot for all developer operations**. We will soon provide a way to link existing users together to persist your developer information across platforms.
