**Ensuring Safe and Open Conversations with Carter**

1. Our characters are created to act and talk just like real people. But sometimes, they might say things that are incorrect, harmful, or unexpected. Remember, it's just a chat - don't take their advice as being 100% accurate or something you should do.
2. When you chat with our characters, they're able to remember things from your past conversations, just like a friend would. This memory is special to your chats and isn't shared with anyone else, even if they're talking to the same character.
3. To use our service, you need to be at least 13 years old, or the age that your country says it's okay to give out your data. In some places, if you're under a certain age, you may also need your parents' permission to use Carter.
4. If you want to see or remove the data for you or your child, just email us at [hello@carterapi.com](mailto:hello@carterapi.com). We're working on making this process even easier for you!
5. We make sure that no personal info is used when training our AI systems that all users interact with.
6. You're in control of your data. You can decide to delete it or take a look at it whenever you want.
7. Help us get better! We welcome feedback over on Discord or via **hello@carterapi.com**\
