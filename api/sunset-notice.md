# Sunset Notice

### What's happening?

On 01 September 2023, the Carter public API will be disabled. This means the following API routes will no longer be accessible: `/chat`, `/context`, `/opener`, `/personalise`, `/speak`, `/transcribe`.

### What's next?

All Carter characters are alive and available now on [Carter Chat](https://www.carter.chat) (www.carter.chat), our brand new first-class experience for meeting and chatting with your favourite characters. In addition, characters can be made public for everyone to experience.

Existing users of the Carter Controller can use the same login credentials to access their characters in Carter Chat.

### What about Plugins?

Carter Chat will continue to support new and existing Plugins going forwards.

### Where's the Controller?

The place to create, modify, and share characters is now within [Carter Chat](https://www.carter.chat).
