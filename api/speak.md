description: Text-to-speech when you need it. (Beta)

# /speak

Our[ /chat](chat.md) endpoint already supports text-to-speech out of the box by simply providing `speak: true` in your request. This however impacts latency. That's why we're now supporting stand-alone speech requests that will use your character's same voice.\
\
You must provide:\
"**text"**: The text you wish to synethsise.\
"**key"**: Your agent's api key.\
**"voice\_id"**: Currently just "male" or "female" - more coming soon ðŸ˜Ž

<summary>Python Example</summary>

```python
import requests

def speak(toSay):
    url = "https://api.carterlabs.ai/speak"
    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
    data = {
        "text": "HELLO CARTER",
        "key": "YOUR API KEY",
        "voice_id": "female"|"male"
    }
    
    try:
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()
        print(data["file_url"])  # Print the file URL
        
        # Play audio from URL (you will need to implement this part)
        # You can use libraries like pydub or playsound to play the audio
        
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print("Error:", e)
