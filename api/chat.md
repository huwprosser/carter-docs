# /chat

Check out how to send a message to your character [here](../quick-start/unity.md). \
\
Sending a message to a Carter character is easy. The `/chat` endpoint supports both text and audio inputs natively. With ASR built into the conversation flow if needed.

### Text Request

```python
import requests
import json

response = requests.post("https://api.carterlabs.ai/api/chat", headers={
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}, data=json.dumps({
    "text": "MESSAGE YOU WANT TO SEND",
    "key": "YOUR API KEY",
    "user_id": "UNIQUE USER ID" # THIS CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT!
}))

print(response.json())
```

### Audio Request

```python
import requests
import json

response = requests.post("https://api.carterlabs.ai/api/chat", headers={
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}, data=json.dumps({
    "audio": "BASE64 WAVE AUDIO CLIP",
    "key": "YOUR API KEY",
    "user_id": "UNIQUE USER ID" # THIS CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT!
}))

print(response.json())
```

### Request Parameters

* **"text":** Used to provide the human's conversational input to the character.
* **"audio"**: Represents a base64-encoded audio clip in the WAVE format. Used to provide audio data to the API as an alternative to text input. If provided, Carter will run the clip through our ASR system.
* **"key"**: Specifies the API key for the character.&#x20;
* **"playerId"**: Placeholder for a unique identifier representing a user in the system. Can be any string value that uniquely identifies a user. Often used in applications where user-specific actions or data need to be tracked or associated. Memories etc will be stored alongside this ID.
* **"speak"**: A boolean flag that determines whether the API should use speech synthesis to provide the output as a spoken audio clip using the characters gender (currently).



### Response

<pre class="language-json"><code class="lang-json">{
