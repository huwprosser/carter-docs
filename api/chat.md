Check out how to send a message to your character [here](../quick-start/unity.md). This page will expand. For now, here's an example response.

```
{
  "output": {
    "text": "RESPONSE FROM CHARACTER",
    "audio": "AUDIO ID" // not yet supported
  },
  "input": "INPUT MESSAGE RECIEVED",
  "forced_behaviours": [
    {
      "name": "NAME OF BEHAVIOUR"
    }
  ]
}
```
