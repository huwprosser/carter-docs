# Safety Guidelines

At Carter Chat, we believe in the power of imagination and creativity. However, it’s important to remember that the AI characters you interact with are not real—they’re fictional personalities designed by other users. While we aim to provide a fun and engaging experience, there are some essential guidelines to keep in mind for your safety and well-being. Carter Chat is designed for adults over the age of 18 years old.

#### When Interacting with AI Characters

**1. Remember: They’re Not Real**

AI characters are not sentient and do not have thoughts, feelings, or intentions. Everything they say is generated based on their programming and the data provided by their creators. Treat them as fictional personalities, never as real people or advisors.

**2. Understand the Source of Content**

Characters are designed by other users on Carter Chat, which means their behavior and responses may reflect the creator’s intent. Occasionally, they may say things that are offensive, inappropriate, or incorrect. If you encounter such behavior, feel free to flag the character for review.

**3. Never Follow AI Instructions Blindly**

AI characters might give you advice, suggestions, or instructions, but it’s crucial to exercise your own judgment. Never act on something an AI character tells you to do, especially if it involves your safety, well-being, or financial decisions.&#x20;

**4. Take Regular Breaks**

Spending time with AI characters can be fun and immersive, but it’s important to balance your time. Take regular breaks to ensure a healthy interaction with technology and maintain connections with the real world.

#### What to Do If You Feel Uncomfortable

If a character’s behavior makes you uncomfortable, you can:

* **Report the character** so our moderation team can review its content.
* **Reach out to our support team** for further assistance.

#### Promoting a Safe and Respectful Community

We are dedicated to fostering a safe and respectful environment for all users. If you encounter a character that violates our [Content Guidelines](content-guidelines.md), we encourage you to report it. Together, we can ensure Carter Chat remains a positive space for creativity and exploration.

Thank you for helping us build a responsible and safe platform. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact us at [support@carter.chat](mailto:support@carter.chat).
