### Join our [<mark style="color:purple;">Discord!</mark>](https://discord.gg/5bPYrJH2qn)

This is the main melting pot where it all goes down... Our discord is HQ of the Carter community, where people share their awesome projects, new startup ideas they want to see in the world, helpful resources and everything in between.

We also have dedicated sections to ask questions, get support, raise feature requests and let us know about bugs or issues. It's super chill and an absolute blast of a community that's open to all skill levels.\
